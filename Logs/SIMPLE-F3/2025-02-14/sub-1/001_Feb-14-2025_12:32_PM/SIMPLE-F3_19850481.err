given by the platformdirs library.  To remove this warning and
see the appropriate new directories, set the environment variable
`JUPYTER_PLATFORM_DIRS=1` and then run `jupyter --paths`.
The use of platformdirs will be the default in `jupyter_core` v6

The current behavior is equivalent to passing `weights=ResNet50_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1`. You can also use `weights=ResNet50_Weights.DEFAULT` to get the most up-to-date weights.
